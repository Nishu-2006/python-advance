### Python Advanced Workshop

This repository contains concepts and code examples from the **Python Advanced Workshop** I attended during my 2nd semester. The workshop was a 10-day intensive training focused on enhancing Python programming skills beyond the basics.

#### Topics Covered:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Error and Exception Handling
* Modules and Packages
* Regular Expressions
* Working with JSON and CSV files
* Introduction to GUI with Tkinter
* Web Scraping (Basics)
* Mini Project using Python

I learned and implemented these concepts as part of the **10-day Python Advanced Workshop in my 2nd semester**.
